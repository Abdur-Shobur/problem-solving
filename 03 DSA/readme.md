# Basics Data Structures

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Hash Tables (Maps & Sets)
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST)
- Graphs
- Heaps & Priority Queues
- Tries

# Time Complexity

- O(1) - Constant Time
- O(log n) - Logarithmic Time

  - O(log N) basically means time goes up linearly while the n goes up exponentially. So if it takes 1 second to compute 10 elements, it will take 2 seconds to compute 100 elements, 3 seconds to compute 1000 elements, and so on.

- O(n) - Linear Time
  - The time grows linearly with the input size
- O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time
- O(n²) - Quadratic Time
- O(n³) - Cubic Time
- O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Time
- O(n!) - Factorial Time
